*The open-source platform for interactive mentorship and pair programming.*

## 🚀 Overview

DevUnite is on a mission to break down the barriers to collaborative learning in software development. We build powerful, open-source tools that enable developers to code together in real-time, learn from each other, and accelerate their growth, regardless of their location or background.

We believe the future of coding education is interactive, communal, and intelligent.

## 📦 Core Project: The DevUnite Platform

The DevUnite Platform is our flagship application—a full-stack, real-time environment for collaborative coding and mentorship.

**🔗 Repository:** [devunite/platform](https://github.com/devunite/platform) | **Status:** `Active Development`

### ✨ Features

*   **Real-Time Collaborative Editor:** Code together with multiple users, featuring live cursors, text synchronization, and user presence.
*   **AI-Powered Assistant:** Get instant explanations, hints, and code reviews from an integrated AI tutor without leaving the editor.
*   **Session Management:** Create, save, and replay coding sessions with structured lesson plans.
*   **Progress Insights:** Visual dashboards to track learning progress and skill development over time.
